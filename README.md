# Open Quran Server

This is a very ambitious project to create a very high performing
webserver to serve Quran texts.

It is implemented after design goals:

* everything from memory (no database, and therefore VERY fast)
* written in Haskell (perfect tool for the job)
* understands reference queries (like: 1:1-4,2:256)
* adheres to the [Quranic Data Formats](https://github.com/oqc/qdf)
* serves JSON for consumption by all
* open source (AGPLv3)

This project is very much a work in progress.
